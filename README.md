# ControllerMoveCursor
Just a small program for a HCI course.
Probably only supports xbox controllers...
The program finds a controller that is plugged in (first if multiple), and afterwards moves the cursor depending on the movement of the left thumbstick. Also supports simulating left mouse click when pressing the "A" button.
